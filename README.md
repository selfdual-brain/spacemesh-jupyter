# Spacemesh-related Jupyter Notebooks
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that can be helpful to play with and set parameters for Spacemesh.

## Running notebooks locally
On a unix-like system that has `bash` and python 3, run

     ./setup.sh

to set up a python virtualenv (in the directory `venv`) and install jupyterlab with its dependencies, and 

     ./jupyter

to start the jupyterlab server. If successful, it should launch a browser window with jupyterlab running, and the notebooks in this directory accessible.

## Running on Colab
Alternatively, you can run the jupyter notebooks on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spacemeshos/notebooks/) without installing anything locally.
